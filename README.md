# rat_optimization

01/06 - Introducing penalty and reward functions into the computation of the optimal trajectory for a linear and quadratic cost (Power_law_models.ipynb). Results are presented differently. 

22/05 - Finally, Keller's model implemented using CasADi in another notebook "Keller_model.ipynb". 

22/05 - CasADi added plus a first notebook using this tool "Power_law_model.ipynb". The optimal trajectory for the rat is computed assuming a linear and quadratic model for the energetic cost. 

15/05 - Big update in the "Cost of motor control" notebook. Hopefullt we've managed to reproduce all the graphs and solve the problem completely for a quadratic cost of time. There seems to be a mistake with their hyperbolic CoT, the equation cannot correspond to the curve shown. 

14/05 - New notebook "Cost of time in Motor Control" reproducing computations by Shadmehr (2010). 

Older: "Cost of physical effort" introduces a simple model for the rat's behavior. Different power laws (to compute the energy expenditure) are investigated. 

Is the energy expenditure of the rats in the experiment optimized?
