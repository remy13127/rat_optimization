# rat_optimization

15/05 - Big update in the "Cost of motor control" notebook. Hopefullt we've managed to reproduce all the graphs and solve the problem completely for a quadratic cost of time. There seems to be a mistake with their hyperbolic CoT, the equation cannot correspond to the curve shown. 

14/05 - New notebook "Cost of time in Motor Control" reproducing computations by Shadmehr (2010). 

Older: "Cost of physical effort" introduces a simple model for the rat's behavior. Different power laws (to compute the energy expenditure) are investigated. 

Is the energy expenditure of the rats in the experiment optimized?
